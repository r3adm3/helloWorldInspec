This repo is me trying to remember how to use Inspec
==

Example Run

```inspec
Adrians-MacBook-Pro:helloWorldInspec adrian$ inspec exec hello_spec.rb 

Profile: tests from hello_spec.rb (tests from hello_spec.rb)
Version: (not specified)
Target:  local://

  ✔  world-1.0: Hello World
     ✔  File hello.txt content should match "Hello World"


Profile Summary: 1 successful control, 0 control failures, 0 controls skipped
Test Summary: 1 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped

```
